/**
 * Capturing what the reporter is looking at, without asking for permission.
 *
 * Two ways, and they are not equivalent:
 *
 *   render  — the DOM re-drawn through an SVG foreignObject, by the browser's own engine.
 *             No permission prompt, and it **can redact**: anything marked `nocapture` is
 *             dropped, which is how the feedback drawer stays out of its own screenshot.
 *   screen  — `getDisplayMedia`. Literally the composited frame, and therefore exact — but
 *             it shows a permission dialog every single time and it cannot redact anything,
 *             because by then the pixels are just pixels.
 *
 * **Render is the default.** Once the clone waits for `document.fonts.ready` the difference
 * is small enough that it is not worth a dialog on every complaint, and the redaction is
 * worth more than the last few per cent of fidelity. The screen path stays available for
 * somebody who explicitly wants exact pixels and will accept the prompt.
 *
 * Nothing is captured when the box opens. A screenshot is taken when somebody asks for one.
